# Unsupervised Scale-consistent Depth Learning from Video

## Introduce
- With unsupervised learning for depth estimation, the color consistency between multiple views serves as the main supervision signal.
- Use video dataset because  it has a minimum requirement for training data.
- Disadvantage: 
    - Unknow scale => ralative depth, opposited to metric in real world while supervised is absolute depth.
    - Video-based learning is that methods may generate scale-inconsistent predictions over different frames since they suffer from a perframe scale ambiguity. This does not impact the single image based tasks, while it is critical for video-based applications,

- New things proposion:
    - **Propose a geometry consistency loss (LG)** to encourage networks to predict scale-consistent depths. It explicitly penalizes the pixel-wise inconsistency of predicted depths between adjacent frames during training. It enables more effective learning and allows for more consistent predictions at inference time
