My name is Hoang and I'm currently a junior at Ho Chi Minh University of Technology (HCMUT).   

Computer Vision came to me at time I had felt disorientated about my career path in Computer Science like a miracle. This blog is a small project of mine for sharing all things i've learnt and my own stories. This blog will be used both English and Vietnamese so please do not be annoyed, i'm so sorry about that.   
  
Finally, Thank you for visiting my own blog. Hope that will help you guys a little bit with Computer Vision.
